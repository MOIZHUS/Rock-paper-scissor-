<!-- // Looping with Array Manipulation:
// Write a JavaScript program that takes an array of integers as input and rearranges the elements in such a way that all the even numbers appear before the odd numbers, without using extra space.

// Looping with Matrix Operations:
// Write a JavaScript program that takes a square matrix (2D array) as input and calculates the sum of the elements in the diagonal from top left to bottom right.

// Looping with String Manipulation:
// Write a JavaScript program that takes a string as input and prints all possible permutations of the characters in the string.

// Looping with Sorting:
// Write a JavaScript program that takes an array of integers as input and sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm.

// Looping with Graph Traversal:
// Write a JavaScript program that performs depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) on a given graph represented as an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.

// Looping with Dynamic Programming:
// Write a JavaScript program that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming instead of recursion to improve performance.

// Looping with Algorithmic Challenges:
// Implement famous algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph or the A* search algorithm for pathfinding on a grid.

// Looping with Functional Programming:
// Write a JavaScript program that uses array methods like map, filter, reduce, etc., to solve complex data manipulation or algorithmic problems.

// Looping with Advanced Data Structures:
// Implement advanced data structures like binary search trees, heaps, or hash tables, and perform operations like insertion, deletion, search, etc., using loops and appropriate algorithms.

// Looping with Parallel Computing:
// Write a JavaScript program that utilizes Web Workers to perform parallel computation tasks, such as matrix multiplication or image processing, to improve performance. -->
